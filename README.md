Project Proposal: Agile Testing Sprint for E-Commerce Website
Context: as a test automation engineer, you are assigned to a team developing new features for an e-commerce platform. The team operates in an agile environment with two-week sprints. At the beginning of a sprint, the team plans to introduce a new payment gateway integration and optimize the product search functionality. The challenge for the team is to ensure that these new features function correctly without disrupting the existing functionalities of the platform.
Objective: Develop and execute a suite of automated functional and regression tests to ensure the new features meet the acceptance criteria and existing functionalities remain unaffected.

# Tasks:
1.Understand the Requirements:
2.Test Planning:
-Identify test scenarios.
-Review existing test scenarios to identify potential areas impacted by the new changes for regression testing.
-Prioritize test scenarios based on critical functionalities and dependencies.
3.Test Development:
-Use Selenium WebDriver for creating automated test scripts. Focus on key functionalities like adding items to the cart, proceeding to checkout, and using the new payment gateway.
-Ensure that search functionality tests include various keywords, filtering options, and sorting mechanisms to validate the new search optimization.
4.Test Execution:
-Execute regression tests to ensure existing features like user registration, login, and previous payment gateways work as expected.
5.Bug Reporting and Retesting:
-Log defects in a bug tracking tool like a Word file.
6.Documentation and Reporting:
-Maintain documentation of test cases, test results, and bug reports.
-Prepare end-of-sprint test summary reports detailing the test outcomes, coverage, and quality metrics.
Suggested Websites for Practice:
-Demo nope commerce.
-OpenCart (http://demo.opencart.com) - An open-source e-commerce platform that is ideal for practicing payment and search functionalities.
-Magento Open Source (https://magento.com/tech-resources/download) - Provides a more complex system with extensive features to test, suitable for practicing more advanced scenarios.
Deliverables:
-List of applicable scenarios with their priority ( risk-based â€“ prioritization ) 
-Determine the tool selection process and its justification.
- testNG? Cucumber tests? value of the approach 
-Selenium 
-Automated test scripts for existing features uploaded on Git Hub.
